# World Population Analysis (2020-2024)

This repository contains an analysis of world population trends from 2020 to 2024. The project utilizes SQL to query and process population data to provide insights into global population growth.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze the world population data and extract key insights, including:
- Total world population growth from 2020 to 2024.
- Population trends in different countries.
- Identifying the top countries with the highest and lowest population growth rates.
- Population trends in different genders.
The analysis was carried out using **SQL** to query the dataset, perform aggregations, and generate meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains population data for different countries from 2020 to 2024. It includes columns such as:
- `Country` - The name of the country.
- `Year` - The year of the population data.
- `Gender` - The population of a gender for the given country and year.

This dataset was retrieved from [source or database name, if applicable].

## Files Included
- **world_population_clean.csv**: SQL queries used to extract and analyze the population data.
- **World_population_rawdata.csv**: The raw population dataset (if you're including it in your repository).
- **world_populati**: Jupyter Notebook that contains the SQL code execution, data processing, and results visualization (optional, if applicable).
